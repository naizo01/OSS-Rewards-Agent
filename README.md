## Overview

OSS-Rewards-Agent is a groundbreaking open source support project that matches contributors with open source projects facing issues, where AI Agents facilitate reward payments to contributors.

## How It Works

1. **Issue Creation**
   - Open source developers or users can create issues with attached cryptocurrency rewards
   - These issues represent improvements or fixes needed in the project

2. **Contributor Matching**
   - Contributors can search through reward-linked issues
   - They can work on issues that match their skills and interests

3. **Reward Distribution**
   - Upon successful merge of a pull request, an AI Agent sends a reward claim link
   - Authentication through GitHub account is required to claim rewards
   - Only contributors whose pull requests are merged can claim the reward for the corresponding issue

## Security Features

The system ensures secure reward distribution through:
- GitHub account authentication requirement
- Verification that only the contributor whose pull request was merged can claim the reward
- Automated validation of contribution completion
